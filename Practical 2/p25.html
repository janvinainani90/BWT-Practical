  AMAZON, the great river of South America. Before the conquest of South America,
  the Rio de las Amazonas had no general name; for, according to a common custom,
  each savage tribe gave a name only to the section of the river which it occupied—such
  as Paranáguazú, Guyerma, Solimões and others. In the year 1500, Vicente Yañez Pinzon,
  in command of a Spanish expedition, discovered and ascended the Amazon to a point about 50 m.
  from the sea. He called it the Rio Santa Maria de la Mar Dulce, which soon became
  abbreviated to Mar Dulce, and for some years, after 1502, it was known as the Rio Grande.
  The principal companions of Pinzon, in giving evidence in 1515, mention it as El Ryo Marañon.
  There is much controversy about the origin of the word Marañon.
